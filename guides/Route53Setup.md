# Route 53 Setup Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a hosted zone in AWS Route 53, connect a domain purchased from GoDaddy, and configure DNS settings to integrate with AWS CloudFront. This is a critical part of setting up your website to ensure it is accessible by your custom domain and benefits from AWS services.

## Prerequisites
- An active AWS account.
- A domain name registered with GoDaddy.
